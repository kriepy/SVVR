In this report we desribe the visualisation of the calcification in the coral .... 

The data is in form of dicom and is gained with a CTscan. We build a pipeline in where the data of a batch corals is seperated, visualised and analysed.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
what is given:\\
2 batches a 10 corals that are scanned in a CT scanner, one batch normal, other in acified water\\
with this data we want to visualise the calcification in the corals\\


\subsection{Coral}
-some information about the coral:\\
2 batches, acified water and not

\subsection{CTscan information}

dicom files\\
contains density values for every voxel\\


\section{The Pipeline}
first seperating the data, so that every coral can be shown alone\\
then then measuring the volume
getting the density 

also give vtk pipeline

\section{Evaluation of methods}
volume estimation with cubes or surfaces

\section{Results}
values from -1000 to 2100(later)
show visualisations
show density graphs
compare with measured(real) values
\section{Conclusion}
